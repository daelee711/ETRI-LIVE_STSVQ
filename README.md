# ETRI-LIVE STSVQ Database
ETRI-LIVE Space-Time Subsampled Video Quality (STSVQ) Database contains 437 videos generated by applying various levels of combined space-time subsampling and video compression on 15 diverse video contents. In this page, we provide a guide on how to obtain the videos and their respective subjective opinion scores. For detailed information, please visit the ETRI-LIVE database [website](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/ETRI-LIVE_STSVQ/index.html).

## Downloading the videos
To download the videos, please fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfk9y1XUWINq4EqsDuTXsfO7bJIPOYcfBUIAU19_QY92M-Qg/viewform) and the download link will be sent to you.
The database consist of 15 original videos provided in the *original_videos* folder and 437 distorted videos provided in the *distorted_videos* folder. 

All videos are provided in YUV file format at 3840x2160, 60/120Hz, and 10 bit. For downloading the entire database, please ensure at least 4.6 TB space available. 


## Subjective Scores
The subjective opinion scores for all 437 distorted videos are provided in [subjective_scores](https://github.com/daelee711/ETRI-LIVE_STSVQ/tree/master/subjective_scores) directory.

## Target bit rate/QP Information
The five target bit rates associated with each source video, along with the corresponding QP and bit rate values of the space-time subsampled videos are provided in [target_bitrate_qp_info](https://github.com/daelee711/ETRI-LIVE_STSVQ/tree/master/target_bitrate_qp_info) directory.
