# ETRI-LIVE Space-Time Subsampled Video Quality (STSVQ) Database
ETRI-LIVE Space-Time Subsampled Video Quality (STSVQ) Database contains 437 videos generated by applying various levels of combined space-time subsampling and video compression on 15 diverse video contents. In this page, we provide a guide on how to obtain the videos and their respective subjective opinion scores. For detailed information, please visit the ETRI-LIVE database [website](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/ETRI-LIVE_STSVQ/index.html).

## Downloading the videos
To download the videos, please fill [THIS FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfk9y1XUWINq4EqsDuTXsfO7bJIPOYcfBUIAU19_QY92M-Qg/viewform) and the download link will be sent to you.
The database consist of 15 original videos and 437 distorted videos. 

All videos are provided in YUV file format at 3840x2160, 60/120Hz, and 10 bit. For downloading the entire database, please ensure at least 4.7 TB space available. 

Linux and Mac users run the following commands in the directory where the database is to be downloaded. Use the password mailed to you when prompted while unzipping the downloaded files. Please ensure there is atleast ~250GB space available before downloading.
```
bash database_download.sh
bash data_unzip.sh
```

## Subjective Scores
Subjective opinion scores are provided in [subjective_scores](https://github.com/daelee711/ETRI-LIVE_STSVQ/tree/master/subjective_scores) directory.

## Target Bitrate/QP Information
The five target bit rates associated with each source video, along with the corresponding QP and bit rate values of the space-time subsampled videos are provided in data.xls
