# Target bitrate/QP Information

We provide a xls file that contains following spreadsheets.

>__1. General information__   
>- contains original video format and frame number information of the contents used in our database.

>__2. Bitrate(QP) for sources__  
>- contains the target bit rate (QP) determined for each source contents to span a wide range of perceptual qualities.
>- contains the average qp/bit rate information across contents at 60/120 Hz.  

>__3. Bitrate(QP) for distorted__  
>- contains the QP and bit rate values of space-time subsampled video, chosen to meet the target bit rates for each source contents.
